Click on "Eclipse Classic 3.7.2" -> Windows 32 bit
Click on the given mirror on this page
It should start downloading now
The downloaded file contains a self-explanatory installer.
For the sake of saving time, we will assume that you have downloaded and installed the eclipse IDE

//Show how to install Android sdk
We will now install the Android SDK
Go to http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
Choose "installer_r18-windows.exe"

//Show how to install ADT Plugin
	//Go to install new software - copy paste link
	Once the android SDK is installed, we will now install the ADT Plugin
	Go to http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html#installing
	Copy the link "https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/"
	Open eclipse
	Go to Help->Install new software
	Paste the link in the box
	Wait for it to load
	Check Android Development Tools
	And click next. This will take time, keep clicking next / finish and the plugin will be installed
	We also need to make eclipse point to the location where the android sdk is installed.
	Go to Window -> Preferences -> Android
	Give it the location of the SDK in the box
	
//Download project from github repo
	Now, that we have setup our IDE, let's download the project code
	Go to "https://github.com/pararthshah/android_interface_firebird_api_group2_cs308_2012"
	Go to Downloads and download the code
	Extract the code
	
//Import Firebird API library
	In eclipse, right click in the package explorer and click Import.
	Select "existing projects into workspace" and point it to the location of the code.

//Import sample app
	Now, in the same way, import the FB Controller code into eclipse.

//Show interface
	In the package explorer, go to res -> layout -> main.xml
	This shows you the layout of the main screen of the app

//Right click and click on Run as..
	To install and run this app on an android device, connect the device to the computer via USB.
	Right click on the project and select Run As->Android Application
	This will install the application on the android phone and you can test it out now!
	
//Show screen shot of bluetooth module connections
	This is the software part of the screen cast.
	We also need to connect the bluetooth module to the firebird.
	The following images will show how the module is connected.
	The TX of the module goes into pin 45 of the Firebird in the slot.
	Refer to the firebird hardware manual to exactly locate this pin.
	The RX of the module goes into pin 46 of the Firebird
	Also, connect the VCC and GND pins as shown in the image.
	The VCC goes in the 2nd row, 2nd pin from the left and GND goes in the 3rd pin in the 2nd row.
	
	This completes the installation instructions. Thank You!
